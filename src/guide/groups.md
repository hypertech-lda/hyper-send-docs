# Groups through API

The Group API provides functionality to manage customer groups. You can perform various actions, such as listing all groups or retrieving specific group details. The API follows RESTful conventions and offers the following endpoints:

## Headers

To ensure proper authentication and communication, include the following headers in your API requests:

| Key           | Value                         |
| ------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Accept        | `application/json`            |
| Content-Type  | `application/json`            |
| Authorization | Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE |

Replace `YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE` with the actual bearer token you have obtained after successful authentication. This token will be used to authenticate your API requests and grant access to the protected endpoints.

### Additional information

The following additional information may be helpful:

- The HyperSend API uses the JSON format for all responses.
<!-- - The HyperSend API uses HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of a request. -->
- The HyperSend API uses the `success` property to indicate whether a request was successful.
- The HyperSend API uses the `message` property to provide additional information about the status of a response.
- The HyperSend API uses the `data` property to return data from a successful request.

### Response structure

The response structure for both error and success responses is the same:

```json
{
  "success": true|false,
  "message": "Response message"
  "data": {}
}
```

The `success` property indicates whether the request was successful. If the request was successful and the `message` property will be a success message. If the request was not successful, the `status` property will be an error code and the `message` property will be an error message.

The `data` property is only present in success responses. It contains the data that was returned by the API. The data structure will vary depending on the API endpoint that was called.
